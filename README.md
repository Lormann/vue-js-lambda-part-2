# Vue.js and AWS Lambda: Developing Production-Ready Apps (Part 2)

In this series, you will use modern technologies like Vue.js, AWS Lambda, Express, MongoDB, and Auth0 to create a production-ready application that acts like a micro-blog engine. [The first part of the series focused on the setup of the Vue.js client and on the definition of the Express backend API](https://auth0.com/blog/vue-js-and-lambda-developing-production-ready-apps-part-1/).

The second part (this one) will show you how to prepare your app for showtime. You will start by signing up to AWS and to mLab (where you will deploy the production MongoDB instance), then you will focus on refactoring both your frontend and backend apps to support different environments (in this case, development and production).

> **Note:** the instructions described in this article probably won't incur any charges. Both AWS and mLab have free tiers that support a good amount of requests and processing. If you don't extrapolate usage, you won't have to pay anything.
